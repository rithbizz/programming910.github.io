  <p style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 50px;">
    Today we learn <strong>if</strong>, <strong>elif</strong>, and <strong>else</strong> — the foundation of all program logic! 🚀

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 Why It Matters
Every useful program needs to make decisions. "If the password is correct, log in. Otherwise, show an error." This is conditional logic!
:::

## Today's Plan

**Conditional Statements — 3 Hours:**

1. **Part 1** — `if` Statement: Run code only when a condition is True
2. **Part 2** — `else` Statement: What happens when the condition is False
3. **Part 3** — `elif` Statement: Checking multiple conditions in order
4. **Part 4** — Nested `if`: Conditions inside conditions
5. **Part 5** — Combining Conditions with `and` / `or`
6. **Part 6** — Practice Projects & Challenges

::: {.callout-tip}
**⏱️ Time:** ~3 hours | **📝 Goal:** Write programs that think and decide!
:::

## Learning Objectives

**By the end of this class, you will:**

- Understand what conditional statements are and why we need them
- Write `if` statements to execute code conditionally
- Use `else` to handle the alternative case
- Use `elif` to handle multiple conditions
- Nest conditions inside each other
- Combine conditions using `and` / `or`
- Build real mini-programs that make decisions

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Hands-On Learning
Every concept comes with live examples and practice exercises you will write yourself!
:::

# Part 1: The `if` Statement

## What is a Conditional Statement?

::: {style="text-align:center; margin-top: 30px;"}
### A **conditional statement** tells Python: *"Only do this if something is true"* {style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 1.4em;"}
:::

**Real-life examples of conditions:**

- **If** it is raining → bring an umbrella
- **If** the score is above 50 → you pass
- **If** the password is correct → allow login

```python
# Without conditions, ALL code always runs
print("Hello!")         # This always runs

# With conditions, code runs ONLY when True
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")   # Only runs if age >= 18
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 Key Idea
Conditional statements let your program respond differently to different situations.
:::

## Syntax of the `if` Statement

**The structure of an `if` statement:**

```python
if condition:
    # code to run when condition is True
    # this block is INDENTED (4 spaces or 1 tab)
```

**Rules to remember:**

- The condition is followed by a **colon** `:`
- The code inside must be **indented** (press Tab or 4 spaces)
- Indented code is called the **body** or **block**

```python
temperature = 35

if temperature > 30:
    print("It is hot today!")
    print("Stay hydrated.")

print("This always runs.")   # Not indented = outside the if
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Indentation is REQUIRED
Python uses indentation to know what belongs inside the `if`. Missing or wrong indentation causes an error!
:::

## Indentation: The Most Important Rule

```python
# ✅ CORRECT — indented with 4 spaces
score = 85
if score >= 50:
    print("You passed!")   # 4 spaces before print

# ❌ WRONG — no indentation → IndentationError
if score >= 50:
print("You passed!")       # ERROR! Must be indented

# ❌ WRONG — inconsistent indentation
if score >= 50:
  print("You passed!")     # 2 spaces
    print("Great job!")    # 4 spaces → ERROR!
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Golden Rule
**Everything inside an `if` block must have the SAME indentation level.**
Use 4 spaces consistently (or Tab — but not both).
:::

## How Python Evaluates the Condition

Python checks if the condition is `True` or `False`:

```python
x = 10

# Condition is True → block RUNS
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")    # ✅ This runs

# Condition is False → block is SKIPPED
if x > 20:
    print("x is greater than 20")   # ❌ This is skipped

print("Done.")   # Always runs
```

**Step-by-step thinking:**

```
x = 10
Is x > 5?  →  Is 10 > 5?  →  True  →  Run the block ✅
Is x > 20? →  Is 10 > 20? →  False →  Skip the block ❌
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Think like Python
Always ask: "Is this condition True or False right now?"
:::

## Multiple Statements in an `if` Block

You can put multiple lines inside one `if`:

```python
score = 92

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
    print("Excellent work!")
    print("You are in the top class.")

# All three lines only run if score >= 90
```

**Another example:**

```python
balance = 500
withdrawal = 200

if withdrawal <= balance:
    balance = balance - withdrawal
    print("Withdrawal successful!")
    print(f"New balance: ${balance}")

print("Thank you for using our ATM.")
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 📌 Remember
All lines at the same indentation level belong to the same block.
:::

## Practice 1A — Write Your First `if` Statement

**Task:** Write a program that:
1. Stores a temperature value
2. Prints a message if the temperature is above 37 (fever)

```python
# Your solution here:
temperature = 38.5

if temperature > 37:
    print("Warning: You may have a fever!")
    print(f"Your temperature is {temperature}°C")

print("Check complete.")
```

**Try changing the temperature to 36.5 — what happens?**

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Exercise
Change `temperature` to different values and observe the output. What is the exact boundary?
:::

## Practice 1B — Age Checker

```python
# Program: Check if someone can vote
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
    print("Please register at your local office.")

print("Thank you for using the voter check system.")
```

**Now try these scenarios:**

| age value | What prints? |
|-----------|--------------|
| `age = 20` | Both lines inside + Thank you |
| `age = 18` | Both lines inside + Thank you |
| `age = 17` | Only Thank you |
| `age = 5`  | Only Thank you |

::: {.callout-note}
## 🔍 Observe
The boundary `>= 18` includes exactly 18. Age 18 is allowed!
:::

---

# Part 2: The `else` Statement

## What is `else`?

::: {style="text-align:center; margin-top: 30px;"}
### `else` runs when the `if` condition is **False** {style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 1.4em;"}

It is the "otherwise" option.
:::

**Real-life thinking:**

- If it is raining → bring umbrella. **Otherwise** → wear sunglasses.
- If score >= 50 → you pass. **Otherwise** → you fail.
- If username is correct → log in. **Otherwise** → show error.

```python
score = 45

if score >= 50:
    print("You passed!")
else:
    print("You failed. Please try again.")
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Key Point
Either the `if` block runs, OR the `else` block runs. **Never both. Never neither.**
:::

## Syntax of `if...else`

```python
if condition:
    # runs when condition is True
    code_block_A
else:
    # runs when condition is False
    code_block_B
```

**Important rules:**

- `else` has NO condition — it is the "everything else" case
- `else` must be at the same indentation as `if`
- `else` also ends with a **colon** `:`
- The body of `else` must be indented

```python
temperature = 22

if temperature > 30:
    print("It is hot!")
else:
    print("The weather is comfortable.")
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Think of it as a fork in the road
`if` takes the left path, `else` takes the right path. You always take one.
:::

## Visualizing if...else Flow

```
         Start
           │
           ▼
     [Check condition]
           │
     ┌─────┴─────┐
   True         False
     │             │
     ▼             ▼
  [if block]   [else block]
     │             │
     └─────┬─────┘
           │
           ▼
     Continue...
```

```python
password = "hello123"

if password == "secret":
    print("Access granted!")
else:
    print("Wrong password. Access denied.")

print("Program ended.")   # Always runs after
```

## Multiple Lines in if...else

Both blocks can have multiple statements:

```python
marks = 72

if marks >= 50:
    print("Result: PASS ✅")
    print(f"Your score: {marks}/100")
    print("Congratulations! You may proceed.")
else:
    print("Result: FAIL ❌")
    print(f"Your score: {marks}/100")
    print("You need to retake the exam.")

print("---")
print("End of result.")
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 📌 Both branches can have different amounts of code
The `if` block can have 1 line, the `else` block can have 5 lines — or vice versa.
:::

## Practice 2A — Pass or Fail

**Task:** Write a program that checks if a student passes or fails.

```python
# Passing score is 50 or above
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

if score >= 50:
    print("🎉 Congratulations! You PASSED.")
    print(f"Your score: {score}/100")
else:
    print("😢 Sorry, you FAILED.")
    print(f"Your score: {score}/100")
    print("Minimum passing score is 50.")
```

**Test with these inputs:**

| Input | Expected Output |
|-------|----------------|
| `85`  | PASSED |
| `50`  | PASSED (boundary!) |
| `49`  | FAILED |
| `0`   | FAILED |

## Practice 2B — Even or Odd

**Using the modulo operator from last class:**

```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is an EVEN number.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is an ODD number.")
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 How it works
`number % 2` gives the remainder when dividing by 2.
- Even numbers: remainder is `0`
- Odd numbers: remainder is `1`
:::

**Try:** 4, 7, 0, 13, 100

## Practice 2C — Positive or Negative

```python
num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

if num >= 0:
    print(f"{num} is a positive number (or zero).")
else:
    print(f"{num} is a negative number.")
```

**Mini Challenge:** Modify the program to also say "You entered zero!" when `num == 0`.

*Hint: Can you use a second `if` inside the `if` block?*

---

# Part 3: The `elif` Statement

## The Problem with Only if...else

What if there are **more than two** possible outcomes?

```python
score = 75

# ❌ This approach is messy and incorrect logic
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
if score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")   # 75 doesn't match, but 90+ would print BOTH A and B!
if score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Problem
Using multiple separate `if` statements means ALL conditions are checked independently. A score of 95 would print A, B, AND C — that's wrong!
:::

**Solution:** Use `elif` to create a **chain** of conditions.

## What is `elif`?

::: {style="text-align:center; margin-top: 30px;"}
### `elif` = "else if" — check another condition only if the previous was False {style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 1.4em;"}
:::

```python
if condition1:
    # runs if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # runs if condition1 is False AND condition2 is True
elif condition3:
    # runs if condition1 and condition2 are False AND condition3 is True
else:
    # runs if ALL conditions above are False
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Key Rule
Python checks conditions **top to bottom** and **stops at the first True one**.
Only ONE block ever runs.
:::

## Syntax: if...elif...else

```python
score = 75

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")

# Output: Grade: C
```

**Step-by-step trace:**

```
Is score >= 90? → Is 75 >= 90? → False → skip
Is score >= 80? → Is 75 >= 80? → False → skip
Is score >= 70? → Is 75 >= 70? → True  → Print "Grade: C" ✅ STOP
```

## Visualizing elif Flow

```
         Start
           │
           ▼
     [condition1?]
           │
     ┌─────┴─────┐
   True         False
     │             │
     ▼             ▼
  [block1]   [condition2?]
     │         ┌──┴──┐
     │       True   False
     │         │       │
     │      [block2] [condition3?]
     │         │      ┌──┴──┐
     │         │    True   False
     │         │      │       │
     │         │  [block3]  [else]
     └──┬──────┘      │       │
        └─────────────┴───────┘
                      │
                      ▼
                  Continue...
```

## How Order Matters in elif

The **order** of your conditions is critical!

```python
score = 95

# ✅ CORRECT ORDER — most restrictive first
if score >= 90:
    print("A")       # 95 >= 90 → True → prints A, stops here ✅
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("C")

# ❌ WRONG ORDER — least restrictive first
if score >= 70:
    print("C")       # 95 >= 70 → True → prints C! Wrong! ❌
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")       # Never reached for score 95
elif score >= 90:
    print("A")       # Never reached for score 95
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Always order from MOST specific to LEAST specific
For ranges: put the highest threshold first (or lowest, depending on direction).
:::

## elif Without else

`else` is **optional**. You can have `if...elif` without a final `else`:

```python
day = "Saturday"

if day == "Saturday":
    print("Weekend! Sleep in. 😴")
elif day == "Sunday":
    print("Weekend! Relax. ☀️")

# If day is Monday-Friday: nothing prints
print("Have a good day!")
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 When to skip `else`
Skip `else` when it is acceptable to do nothing if no condition matches.
Include `else` when you need a guaranteed fallback action.
:::

## Practice 3A — Grade Calculator

**Write a full grade calculator:**

```python
score = int(input("Enter your exam score (0-100): "))

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
    remark = "Excellent!"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
    remark = "Very Good!"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
    remark = "Good"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
    remark = "Satisfactory"
elif score >= 50:
    grade = "E"
    remark = "Pass"
else:
    grade = "F"
    remark = "Fail — Please retake"

print(f"Score: {score}/100")
print(f"Grade: {grade}")
print(f"Remark: {remark}")
```

## Practice 3A — Test Cases

Test your grade calculator with these values:

| Score | Expected Grade | Expected Remark |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 95    | A | Excellent! |
| 83    | B | Very Good! |
| 75    | C | Good |
| 62    | D | Satisfactory |
| 55    | E | Pass |
| 40    | F | Fail — Please retake |
| 50    | E | Pass (boundary!) |
| 90    | A | Excellent! (boundary!) |

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Always test boundary values
The exact cutoff points (50, 60, 70, 80, 90) are where mistakes happen!
:::

## Practice 3B — BMI Calculator

**Body Mass Index (BMI) = weight(kg) / height(m)²**

```python
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
print(f"\nYour BMI: {bmi:.2f}")

if bmi < 18.5:
    category = "Underweight"
    advice = "Consider eating more nutritious food."
elif bmi < 25.0:
    category = "Normal weight"
    advice = "Great! Keep maintaining your lifestyle."
elif bmi < 30.0:
    category = "Overweight"
    advice = "Consider more physical activity."
else:
    category = "Obese"
    advice = "Please consult a healthcare professional."

print(f"Category: {category}")
print(f"Advice: {advice}")
```

## Practice 3C — Day Type Checker

```python
day = input("Enter a day of the week: ").strip().capitalize()

if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
    print(f"{day} is a Weekend! 🎉")
elif day in ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]:
    print(f"{day} is a Weekday. 💼")
else:
    print(f"'{day}' is not a valid day name.")
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 New trick: `in` operator
`day in ["Monday", "Tuesday", ...]` checks if `day` matches any item in the list.
We will study lists in detail later — for now, use it to simplify multiple OR conditions!
:::

# Part 4: Nested `if` Statements

## What is Nesting?

::: {style="text-align:center; margin-top: 30px;"}
### A **nested `if`** is an `if` statement placed **inside** another `if` statement {style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 1.4em;"}
:::

**Real-life example:**

- If you have a ticket:
  - If your seat is in row A → go to the front
  - Else → go to the back
- Else → you cannot enter

```python
has_ticket = True
seat_row = "A"

if has_ticket:
    print("Welcome!")
    if seat_row == "A":
        print("Please go to the front section.")
    else:
        print("Please go to the back section.")
else:
    print("Sorry, no ticket — cannot enter.")
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Key Idea
The inner `if` only runs if the outer `if` condition is True first.
:::

## Syntax of Nested if

```python
if outer_condition:
    # outer block
    if inner_condition:
        # inner block (indented deeper)
        inner_code
    else:
        # inner else block
        inner_else_code
else:
    outer_else_code
```

**Each level of nesting = 4 more spaces of indentation:**

```python
age = 20
has_id = True

if age >= 18:
    print("Age is valid.")      # 4 spaces
    if has_id:
        print("ID confirmed.")  # 8 spaces
        print("Access granted!")
    else:
        print("No ID found. Cannot enter.")
else:
    print("Too young. Access denied.")
```

## Nested if — Step by Step

```python
username = "admin"
password = "secret123"

if username == "admin":
    print("Username correct.")
    if password == "secret123":
        print("Password correct.")
        print("✅ Login successful! Welcome, Admin.")
    else:
        print("❌ Wrong password.")
else:
    print("❌ Username not found.")
```

**Trace through different combinations:**

| username | password | Output |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `"admin"` | `"secret123"` | Login successful |
| `"admin"` | `"wrong"` | Wrong password |
| `"user"` | `"secret123"` | Username not found |
| `"user"` | `"wrong"` | Username not found |

## Caution: Don't Over-Nest!

Too much nesting makes code hard to read:

```python
# ❌ Hard to read — too deeply nested
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        if condition3:
            if condition4:
                print("Finally!")

# ✅ Better — use and to combine conditions
if condition1 and condition2 and condition3 and condition4:
    print("Finally!")
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Rule of Thumb
Try not to nest more than 2–3 levels deep. Use `and` / `or` to flatten your logic when possible.

## Practice 4A — Ticket Price System

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
is_student = input("Are you a student? (yes/no): ").lower()

if age < 5:
    price = 0
    category = "Child (Free)"
elif age <= 12:
    price = 2.00
    category = "Child"
elif age <= 60:
    if is_student == "yes":
        price = 3.50
        category = "Student"
    else:
        price = 7.00

else:
    price = 4.00
    category = "Senior"

print(f"\nCategory: {category}")
print(f"Ticket Price: ${price:.2f}")

## Practice 4B — Season and Activity

```python
month = int(input("Enter the month number (1-12): "))
is_weekend = input("Is it a weekend? (yes/no): ").lower()

if 3 <= month <= 5:

## 💡 New Syntax: Ternary / Inline if
`value_if_true if condition else value_if_false` — a shorthand for simple if/else.
We will explore this more in a moment!

# Part 5: Combining Conditions

## Recap: Logical Operators with if

From last class, we know `and`, `or`, `not`. Now we use them powerfully inside `if` statements:

```python
age = 25
income = 3000

# AND: both must be True
if age >= 18 and income >= 1000:
    print("You qualify for the loan.")

# OR: at least one must be True
if age < 18 or income < 500:
    print("You do not qualify.")

# NOT: reverse the condition
is_banned = False
if not is_banned:
    print("You may access the system.")
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Natural language mapping
"If age is at least 18 **and** income is at least 1000" → `age >= 18 and income >= 1000`
:::

## Using `and` in if Statements

**Both conditions must be True for the block to run:**

```python
username = input("Username: ")
password = input("Password: ")

if username == "admin" and password == "1234":
    print("✅ Login successful!")
else:
    print("❌ Invalid credentials.")
```

**Range checking with `and`:**

```python
temperature = float(input("Enter temperature (°C): "))

if temperature >= 20 and temperature <= 35:
    print("🌤️ Comfortable weather for outdoor activities.")
elif temperature < 20:
    print("🧥 It is cold. Wear a jacket!")
else:
    print("🌡️ It is very hot. Stay in the shade!")
```

## Using `or` in if Statements

**At least one condition must be True:**

```python
day = input("Enter today's day: ").capitalize()

if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
    print("🎉 It's the weekend! No school today.")
else:
    print("📚 It's a weekday. Time to study!")
```

**Another example:**

```python
fruit = input("Enter a fruit: ").lower()

if fruit == "apple" or fruit == "pear" or fruit == "cherry":
    print("That is a pome or stone fruit.")
elif fruit == "mango" or fruit == "banana":
    print("That is a tropical fruit.")
else:
    print("Unknown fruit category.")
```

## Using `not` in if Statements

**Reverse a condition:**

```python
is_logged_in = False

if not is_logged_in:
    print("Please log in to continue.")
else:
    print("Welcome back!")
```

**Practical use:**

```python
username = input("Enter username: ")
banned_users = ["spam", "hacker", "troll"]

if username not in banned_users:
    print(f"Welcome, {username}!")
else:
    print("Your account has been suspended.")
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 `not in` operator
`x not in list` is the opposite of `x in list`. Very readable and natural!
:::

## Complex Conditions — Parentheses Matter!

```python
age = 17
has_parent = True
has_id = False

# With parentheses — clear logic
if age >= 18 or (age >= 15 and has_parent):
    print("You may enter.")
else:
    print("Entry not allowed.")

# Without parentheses — confusing!
# Python evaluates 'and' before 'or', but add parentheses to be explicit
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Precedence Reminder
`not` → `and` → `or` (same as we learned last class!)
**Always use parentheses** when mixing `and` and `or` to make your intent clear.
:::

## Practice 5A — Loan Eligibility

```python
print("=== Loan Eligibility Checker ===")
age = int(input("Your age: "))
income = float(input("Monthly income ($): "))
credit_score = int(input("Credit score (300–850): "))

if age >= 21 and income >= 2000 and credit_score >= 650:
    print("\n✅ Congratulations! You are ELIGIBLE for a loan.")
    max_loan = income * 12
    print(f"Maximum loan amount: ${max_loan:,.2f}")
elif age >= 21 and income >= 2000:
    print("\n⚠️ Partially eligible. Your credit score is too low.")
    print("Minimum credit score required: 650")
elif age < 21:
    print("\n❌ Not eligible. Minimum age is 21.")
else:
    print("\n❌ Not eligible. Minimum monthly income is $2,000.")
```

## Practice 5B — Password Strength Checker

```python
password = input("Enter a password to check: ")

length_ok = len(password) >= 8
has_upper = any(c.isupper() for c in password)
has_lower = any(c.islower() for c in password)
has_digit = any(c.isdigit() for c in password)

print(f"\nPassword: {password}")
print(f"Length >= 8: {length_ok}")
print(f"Has uppercase: {has_upper}")
print(f"Has lowercase: {has_lower}")
print(f"Has digit: {has_digit}")

if length_ok and has_upper and has_lower and has_digit:
    print("\n💪 Strong password!")
elif length_ok and (has_upper or has_lower) and has_digit:
    print("\n👍 Medium strength password. Add more variety.")
else:
    print("\n⚠️ Weak password! Use at least 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.")
```

# Part 6: Inline if (Ternary Expression)

## Shorthand if...else

For simple one-line decisions, Python has a compact syntax:

```python
# Normal if...else
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    status = "adult"
else:
    status = "minor"

# Equivalent Ternary / Inline if
status = "adult" if age >= 18 else "minor"

print(status)   # adult
```

**Syntax:**
```python
value = result_if_true if condition else result_if_false
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 When to use it
Use the ternary form when the choice is simple and fits on one readable line.
For complex logic, always use a full if...else for clarity.
:::

## Ternary Examples

```python
# Example 1: Pass/Fail label
score = 73
result = "Pass" if score >= 50 else "Fail"
print(f"Result: {result}")          # Pass

# Example 2: Absolute value
num = -15
absolute = num if num >= 0 else -num
print(f"Absolute value: {absolute}")  # 15

# Example 3: Max of two numbers
a, b = 10, 25
maximum = a if a > b else b
print(f"Maximum: {maximum}")         # 25

# Example 4: Greeting
hour = 14
greeting = "Good morning" if hour < 12 else "Good afternoon"
print(greeting)                      # Good afternoon
```

## Practice 6A — Quick Decisions

```python
# Practice: Write each as a ternary expression

# 1. Number sign
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sign = "positive" if num >= 0 else "negative"
print(f"{num} is {sign}.")

# 2. Divisible by 5?
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
msg = "divisible by 5" if n % 5 == 0 else "not divisible by 5"
print(f"{n} is {msg}.")

# 3. Larger number
x = float(input("Enter x: "))
y = float(input("Enter y: "))
larger = x if x > y else y
print(f"The larger number is: {larger}")
```

## Final Challenge — Number Analysis Tool

**Combine everything you've learned:**

```python
print("=== Number Analyzer ===")
num = float(input("Enter any number: "))

# Check zero
if num == 0:
    print("The number is ZERO.")

        parity = "EVEN" if num_int % 2 == 0 else "ODD"
        print(f"It is an {parity} integer.")

        # Check if divisible by 3 and 5
        if num_int % 3 == 0 and num_int % 5 == 0:
            print("Divisible by both 3 and 5 (FizzBuzz!).")
        elif num_int % 3 == 0:

## Summary: if, elif, else

**What you've learned today:**

| Concept | Purpose | Syntax |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `if` | Run code only when True | `if condition:` |
| `else` | Run code when `if` is False | `else:` |
| `elif` | Check additional conditions | `elif condition:` |
| Nested `if` | Decisions within decisions | Indent deeper |
| Combined conditions | `and`, `or`, `not` | `if a and b:` |
| Ternary | One-line shorthand | `x if cond else y` |

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Key Takeaways
- Python reads conditions **top to bottom** and stops at the **first True**
- Indentation is **mandatory** — 4 spaces per level
- Use `elif` (not multiple `if`) when choices are mutually exclusive
- Use parentheses to make complex conditions clear
- Test all your **boundary values** (the exact cutoff numbers)!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

```python
# ❌ Mistake 1: Using = instead of ==
if age = 18:           # SyntaxError!
if age == 18:          # ✅ Correct

# ❌ Mistake 2: Missing colon
if age >= 18           # SyntaxError!
if age >= 18:          # ✅ Correct

# ❌ Mistake 3: Wrong indentation
if age >= 18:
print("Adult")         # IndentationError!
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")     # ✅ Correct

# ❌ Mistake 4: elif without if
elif score >= 80:      # SyntaxError! (no if before it)

# ❌ Mistake 5: else with a condition
else score < 50:       # SyntaxError! else has no condition
else:                  # ✅ Correct
```

## Quick Reference Card

```python
# Structure 1: if only
if condition:
    code

# Structure 2: if...else
if condition:
    code_A
else:
    code_B

# Structure 3: if...elif...else
if condition1:
    code_A
elif condition2:
    code_B
elif condition3:
    code_C
else:
    code_D

# Structure 4: Nested
if outer:
    if inner:
        code_A
    else:
        code_B

# Structure 5: Ternary
result = value_A if condition else value_B
```

## Next Class

Next class we will learn about **loops** — repeating actions with `for` and `while`!

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🚀 Get Ready
Loops + Conditions = Real programs that process data, validate input, and solve complex problems!

**Practice at home:** Write a program that asks for a user's age and tells them:
- What generation they belong to (Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X, Boomer)
- Whether they are a minor, adult, or senior
- What discounts they qualify for
